# README #

This repo holds a slim down version of my regular dotfiles for devpod containers.
Some additions on development specific features may be made like AI assistant or development specific plugins.

Should be used in conjunction with GNU stow.

The setup script is executed automatically when this dotfiles repo is used in the devpods startup option.
